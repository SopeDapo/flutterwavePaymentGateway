# flutterwavePaymentGateway
Sample php code for flutterwave payment v3 integration.

Remember, you will need to replace the placeholders your_public_key and your_secret_key with your actual Flutterwave API keys. You will also need to adjust the payload data to match your specific payment requirements.

Note that this code uses the curl library to send the HTTP request to the Flutterwave API. If curl is not installed on your server, you may need to use a different HTTP client library.
